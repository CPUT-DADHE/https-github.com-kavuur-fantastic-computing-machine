# Data Analytics for Clinical Guidance on Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccination for Patients with Co-morbidities and Prior Infection

This study seeks to facilitate risk management of COVID-19 vaccinated individuals with comorbidity
profiles and those with a history of prior infection of COVID-19 by using data analytics. The study
has two goals. The first is to provide clinical-decision support for healthcare workers in the handling
of cases of COVID-19 reinfection and breakthrough infection after partial and full vaccination,
respectively. The second is to offer advice on appropriate policy positions on vaccination strategy
at the national and provincial levels. To do this, we propose a data analytics framework that will
1enable data collection from vaccinated persons through low cost and readily accessible means (e.g.
social media, mobile app, text messaging, webform) and Transparent predictive analytics (TPA).
The TPA that will be achieved by applying Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods will utilize
data obtained from three sources which are (1) COVID-19 infection report, (2) feedback after
vaccination, and (3) pathology-supported genetic testing data. This will ensure that predictive
analytics results are accompanied by relevant explanations that can aid healthcare workers to
improve clinical management of complications from COVID-19 infection following vaccination. The
TPA will focus on both providing personalized treatment recommendations on patient cases and on
developing clinical guidance for health professionals seeing such patients. The output of the
predictive analytics will also be aggregated to provide useful insights that can inform health policy
and the coordination of national/provincial vaccination strategies, as well as provide evidence on the
effectiveness of specific types of vaccine (e.g. Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines). We will
conduct the evaluation based on feedback from healthcare workers that used our tool. The
evaluation will also include assessing the effect of pathology-supported genetic testing (PSGT) on
the provision of effective clinical decision support by healthcare workers, who previously referred
patients for pathology-supported genetic testing (PSGT). The study is expected to increase
productivity and efficiency in handling COVID-19 cases in the face of the emergence of new COVID-
19 variants, and facilitate proactive policy formulation on vaccination strategy at the national and
provincial levels.
